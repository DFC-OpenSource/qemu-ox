# OX: Open-Channel SSD Controller

OX is a controller solution for programmable devices like the dragon Fire Card. OX exposes the
device as a LightNVM compatible Open-Channel SSD. OX has been developed to work
as a hybrid controller, potentially supporting different FTL responsabilities (e.g. write
buffering or ECC) or a full-fledged FTL. FTLs are registered within the OX core,
enabling applications to select channels to be managed by a specific FTL. Within a
device we may have different channels managed by different FTLs.

We have implemented a PCIe interconnection handler, a media manager to expose 8
channels, NVMe and LightNVM support for the DFC.

```
OX DOES NOT HAVE A FTL FOR STANDARD BLOCK DEVICES, FOR NOW OX WORKS ONLY AS OPEN-CHANNEL CONTROLLER.
NEXT RELEASES WILL CONTAIN FEATUTES LIKE FTL IMPLEMENTATION, FABRICS AND RDMA.
```

This controller supports the FPGA 3.01.00. For FPGA 2.05.01, please go to specific branch.

Features:

```
      - Media managers: NAND, DDR, etc.
      - Flash Translation Layers + LightNVM raw FTL support
      - Interconnect handler: PCIe, network fabric, etc.
      - NVMe queues and tail/head doorbells
      - NVMe, LightNVM and Fabric(not implemented) command parser
      - RDMA handler(not implemented): RoCE, InfiniBand, etc.

      Media managers (MMGR): Identifies the non-volatile memory, and registers a channel
        abstraction with its geometry to be available to the stack. Media managers
        implement read/write/erase commands to specific pages and blocks. OX may have
        several media managers exposing channels from different sources.
        
      Flash Translation Layers (FTL): Manages MMGR channels, accepts IO commands (a
        command may have several pages) and sends page-level commands to the media
        managers. It implements responsibilities such as WL, L2P, GC, BB and ECC. Several
        FTLs may run within OX and be responsible to manage different MMGR channels.

      Interconnect handlers (ICH): Communication between controller and host. This layer
        implements responsibilities such as NVMe register mapping and MSI interruptions. It
        gathers data from the host and sends it to the command parser layer.
        
      NVMe queue support: Read/write NVMe registers mapped by the ICH, manage admin/
        IO NVMe queue(s) and perform the DMA data transfer.
        
      Command parsers: Parses commands coming from the ICH and call the right FTL
        instance to handle it.
    
        Since media managers expose NAND as channels, applications can make 
    bindings between channels and FTLs. It means that inside a device we can 
    have different channels managed by different FTLs.
```

HOW TO INSTALL AND USE:

The Makefile creates 2 binaries (ox-ctrl and ox-ctrl-test). ox-ctrl is a essential-only binary for a production environment. ox-ctrl-test is a complete binary including all tests and administration mode.

Under /bin you can find both binaries + the DFC rootfs with OX included. 

WE RECOMMEND THE USE OF ROOTFS. AFTER UPGRADE THE ROOTFS FIRMWARE, ONLY TYPE 'ox-ctrl' OR 'ox-ctrl-test' TO USE OX.

OX accepts parameters as follow:

#ox-ctrl start
```
Use 'start' to run the controller with standard settings.
```

#ox-ctrl debug
```
Use 'debug' to run the controller in debug mode (verbose).
```

#ox-ctrl --help
```

OX Controller ADMIN
 
Available OX Admin Tasks: 

  - 'erase-blk': erase specific blocks.
     eg. ox-ctrl admin -t erase-blk

  - 'erase-lun': erase specific LUNs.
     eg. ox-ctrl admin -t erase-lun (not implemented)

  - 'erase-ch': erase specific channels.
     eg. ox-ctrl admin -t erase-ch (not implemented)
```

#OX layer registration:

```
Besides the DFC, OX is extensible to other devices through the layer registration interface. In order to
use OX in other platforms, it is needed to develop the follow layers:

- Interconnect handler: Here you map the NVMe registers according your platform, or make a Fabrics interconnection.
- Media Manager: Here you abstract the channels of your non-volatile memory as channels, to be used by the other OX layers.
- FTL: You can use the same FTL at any platform, but you can develop a new one and register it within the OX core.
```
